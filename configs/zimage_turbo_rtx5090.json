    "Z-Image Turbo: 2-3x faster encoding/decoding than standard VAE",
    "RTX 5090 can handle batch_size=24 at 1024x1024 (~24GB VRAM)",
    "For ultra-fast training: batch_size=32 at 768x768",
    "For maximum resolution: batch_size=8 at 2048x2048",
    "Training speed: ~0.4-0.5 sec/batch at 1024x1024",
    "Inference speed: ~15-20ms per image encoding",
    "Best for: Real-time applications, quick iterations, production deployments"
